Just drop your favorite objects onto the list. If you quickly want to access them, click on its button in the list and the object will be selected (and pinged).

The following objects are supported:
- Folders
- All assets / objects in the project view (like prefabs)
- GameObjects
So basically everything which is a UnityEngine.Object.

The search works exactly like the Unity search (type search supported).
E.g. "t:Camera" gives you a list with GameObjects containing the Camera component. 

Now free and open source!
